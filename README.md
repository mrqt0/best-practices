# best-practices

This project represents a central reference point for best practices in python
(later possibly other languages as well). Such, it provides templates and 
enforces a common style in other projects.

This may encompass:
- Shebang
- Formatting
- The use of standard modules
  - logger
  - argparse
  - etc.
- Doctrings
- Project layouts

Where there is no such thing as "best", we will decide on one option.
