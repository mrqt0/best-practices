# Confluence

- Uses **pages** organized into **spaces**.
- Pages can be hierarchically structured into a **page tree**.
- Each space has **shortcuts**
- Pages can be tagged with **labels**
- Pages can be created from **templates**, e.g. meeting notes
- **Page enhancements** starting with a forward slash add special features,
  e.g. `/date`
- Pages start as a **draft** until you publish it
- Anyone who is editing a page can automatically see changes,
  because they are automatically saved and synced.
  However, you need to **publish** a page for a new version to appear
  to viewers.
